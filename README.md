# Accessing_Mapping_GBIFdata

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/datatas/Accessing_Mapping_GBIFdata/HEAD)

GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) is a global organisation that aims to providing open access data about life (from bacteria to large vertebrate) on Earth to anyone with an internet connection. To facilitate data analysis, GBIF uses [Darwin Core](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) data standards.

This workshop guides you through to how to access GBIF data and how to create simple maps with the `rgbif` and `leaflet` packages for `R`. This workshop is based on material freely available through the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif) and [`rgbif`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/rgbif.html) websites, as well as material from [Paul Oldham](https://poldham.github.io/abs/gbif.html). All packages needed to run this script (i.e., dependencies) can be found in the `renv.lock` file. You can load all dependencies by running the following line: `renv::restore()` in RStudio.
